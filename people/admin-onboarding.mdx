The HR Admin dashboard allows you to add new employees, track onboarding progress, and review submitted documents.

## Adding a New Employee

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Employees">
    Go to **People > Employees** or `/people/employees`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Employee">
    Click the **Add Employee** button in the top right
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in Details">
    Complete the employee information form
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit">
    Click **Add Employee** to create their account
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Required Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Full Name** | Employee's legal name |
| **Email** | Used for login and communications |
| **Job Title** | Their position at the company |
| **Department** | Select from dropdown |
| **Worker Type** | Employee, Contractor, or Temporary |
| **Hire Date** | Official start date |

### What Happens Next

When you add an employee, the system automatically:

1. Creates a user account with temporary password
2. Generates an Employee ID (format: `ST-XXXX`)
3. Sets their status to `pending_confirmation`
4. Sends an invitation email to complete onboarding

<Note>
The employee will receive an email with a link to access the onboarding portal at `/onboarding`
</Note>

## Tracking Onboarding Progress

### Onboarding Dashboard

Navigate to **People > Onboarding** or `/people/onboarding` to see:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pending Onboarding** | Employees still completing steps |
| **Fully Onboarded** | Employees with active status |
| **Total Employees** | All employees in the system |

### Filtering Employees

Use the filter buttons to view:
- **All** - All employees regardless of status
- **Pending** - Only employees with incomplete onboarding
- **Completed** - Only fully onboarded employees

### Employee Detail View

Click on any employee to view their detailed onboarding status at `/people/onboarding/[employeeId]`:

- Progress bar showing completed steps
- Timestamp for each completed step
- List of submitted documents

## Reviewing Documents

### Document Tab

From the employee detail view, click the **Documents** tab to see all submitted documents.

Each document shows:
- Document type (W-9, W-4, Direct Deposit)
- Submission date and time
- Electronic signature
- Current approval status

### Approving Documents

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Information">
    Verify the form data and signature are correct
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Approve">
    Click the **Approve** button on the document
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    The status changes to **Approved** with a timestamp
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Rejecting Documents

If a document needs corrections:

1. Click **Reject** on the document
2. The employee is notified to resubmit
3. They can submit a corrected version from their portal

## Re-onboarding an Employee

To have an existing employee go through onboarding again:

<Warning>
This requires database access. Contact your system administrator to run this query.
</Warning>

```sql
UPDATE drivers
SET
  onboarding_status = 'pending_confirmation',
  onboarding_step = 1,
  code_of_ethics_signed_at = NULL,
  w9_submitted_at = NULL,
  tax_withholding_submitted_at = NULL,
  direct_deposit_submitted_at = NULL,
  onboarding_completed_at = NULL
WHERE id = 'employee-uuid-here';
```

After running this query:
- The employee appears in the **Pending** filter
- They can access `/onboarding` to complete steps again
- All previous timestamps are cleared

## Onboarding Steps Reference

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Employee not appearing in onboarding list">
    - Check the **All** filter to see all employees
    - They may already have `active` status
    - Verify their record exists in the database
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Documents not showing for employee">
    - Confirm the employee has accessed the onboarding portal
    - Check that they've actually submitted documents
    - Verify the document types match (`w9`, `w4`, `direct_deposit`)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Onboarding step not advancing">
    - Check for browser console errors on employee's device
    - Verify RLS policies allow updates to the `drivers` table
    - May need to manually update `onboarding_step` via database
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Employee didn't receive invitation email">
    - Verify the email address is correct
    - Check their spam/junk folder
    - Resend the invitation from the employee detail page
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
