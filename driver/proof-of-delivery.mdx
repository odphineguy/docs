## Why Proof of Delivery Matters

Proof of delivery (PoD) creates a verified record that goods were delivered correctly. This protects both Saguaro and our clients.

## Capture Methods

### Digital Signature
Have the recipient sign on your device screen:
1. Tap **Capture Signature**
2. Hand device to recipient
3. They sign with their finger
4. Tap **Save**

### Photo Documentation
Take photos of:
- Delivered packages at location
- Recipient with packages
- Any damage or issues
- Delivery location for proof

### Barcode Scanning
Scan package barcodes to:
- Verify correct items delivered
- Create chain of custody records
- Link physical goods to digital records

## Automatic Records

The system automatically captures:
- **GPS coordinates** - Exact delivery location
- **Timestamp** - When delivery occurred
- **Driver ID** - Who made the delivery

## Accessing Past Deliveries

View your delivery history and proof of delivery records in the **History** section of your portal.
