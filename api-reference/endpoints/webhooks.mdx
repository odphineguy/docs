## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when shipment events occur. Instead of polling our API, we'll send HTTP POST requests to your endpoint.

## Setting Up Webhooks

1. Log in to your Client Portal
2. Navigate to **Settings > Webhooks**
3. Add your endpoint URL
4. Select which events to receive
5. Save and test your webhook

## Webhook Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `shipment.created` | New shipment created |
| `shipment.dispatched` | Driver assigned |
| `shipment.picked_up` | Cargo picked up |
| `shipment.in_transit` | Shipment in transit |
| `shipment.delivered` | Successfully delivered |
| `shipment.exception` | Issue or delay occurred |

## Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "event": "shipment.delivered",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:25:00Z",
  "data": {
    "tracking_number": "SGT-2024-00001",
    "status": "delivered",
    "delivered_at": "2024-01-15T14:25:00Z",
    "signed_by": "Jane Receiver"
  }
}
```

## Verifying Webhooks

Each webhook includes a signature header for verification:

```
X-Saguaro-Signature: sha256=abc123...
```

Verify by computing HMAC-SHA256 of the payload using your webhook secret.

## Retry Policy

Failed webhooks are retried:
- 3 attempts over 1 hour
- Exponential backoff between retries
- After 3 failures, webhook is disabled (you'll be notified)
