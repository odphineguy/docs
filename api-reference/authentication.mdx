## API Keys

All API requests require authentication using an API key passed in the header.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.saguarotransport.com/v1/shipments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Obtaining API Keys

1. Log in to your Client Portal
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Access**
3. Click **Generate New Key**
4. Copy and securely store your key

<Warning>
API keys grant full access to your account. Never share them or commit them to version control.
